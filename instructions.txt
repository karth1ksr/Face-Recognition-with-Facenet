pre-requisites : Python 3.9
I will also share code to extract embeddings from the images so that you can test it with your own set of images. 
Keep the following in mind while doing so:
-> This code is applicable for directory which contains sub-directories where each sub-directories contains multiple images.
->You only have to edit the path of the directory to the path of your own directory in line 51. As for saving files you can choose whatever name you want. You can also you this code for testing
Run faceenc.py to find the embeddings of the images while implementing the above point.

As for cross-validation:
-> you have to edit the path of your npz file (in line 9) which contains the embeddings of the train dataset. 
-> Execute the cross validation.py by applying this changes to get the results.

For Testing the performance of the classifier:
->Same as the cross validation, you have to edit the path of your npz file (in line 8 ) to load the embeddings of the dataset to train the model.
->Now, for testing the performance of the model, you have to edit the path of your npz file (in line 12) which contains the embeddings of the test dataset.
-> Execute the testing.py by applying this changes to get the results.

Just for testing purpose I will provide you the embeddings of the train and test dataset just to check the model performance. If you want you can create the embeddings of your own for train and test with the help of faceenc.py
